#this is my vimrc file

it teaches vim to pull some neat tricks

like:

build visual studio solutions based on your current file. 

open netbeans on the same file, same line as you are currently on.

do git adds, commits, statuses, commit graphs, history of current file

open firefox on the currently visually selected url 

Run the perg search utility (a code-grep in one of my other projects)

Run the find search utility

open files from the outputs of these utilities

open files from a visually selected path string

there is some half baked stuff for tfvc as well. 

be aware though that i work on cygwin on windows so there are some things that are specific to it.
